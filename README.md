# SAS Cortex Competition
This project is to create a predictive model to analyze the donor's behavior to maximize the operating surplus for the fundraising campaign. The model is created by SAS.

The detailed description is in [Cortex_Introduction.pdf](Cortex_Introduction.pdf) and [Know_the_Game.pdf](Know_the_Game.pdf).

The predictive model we created uses logistic regression to calculate the chance of donation before and after contact. And we use multiple linear regression to predict the donation amount. The detailed model is in [Cortex. sas](Cortex.sas).

Please see the [Presentation. pptx](Presentation.pptx) for further explanation.
